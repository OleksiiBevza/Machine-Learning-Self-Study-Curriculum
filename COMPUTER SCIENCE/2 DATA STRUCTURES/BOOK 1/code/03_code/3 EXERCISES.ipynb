    "Add a method called `deduplicate()` to the Array class in the SortArray.py module (Listing 3-4) that removes duplicates from a previously sorted array without disrupting the order. You can use any of the sort methods in your test program to sort the data. You can imagine schemes in which all the items from the place where a duplicate was discovered to the end of the array would be shifted down one space every time a duplicate was discovered, but this would lead to slow **O(N2)** time, at least when there were a lot of duplicates. In your algorithm, make sure no item is moved more than once, no matter how many duplicates there are. This will give you an algorithm with O(N) time."

    "Another simple sort is the odd-even sort. The idea is to repeatedly make two passes through the array. On the first pass, you look at all the pairs of items, a[j] and a[j + 1],  \n",
    "where j is odd (j = 1, 3, 5, …). If their key values are out of order, you swap them. On the second pass, you do the same for all the even values (j = 0, 2, 4, …). You do these two passes repeatedly until the array is sorted. Add an oddEvenSort() method to the Array class in the SortArray.py module (Listing 3-4). Perform the outer loop until no swaps occur to see how many passes are needed; one pass includes both odd-pair and even-pair swapping. Make sure it works for varying amounts of data and on good and bad initial orderings. After testing how many passes are needed before no more swaps occur, determine the maximum number of passes of the outer loop based on the length of the input array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The odd-even sort is actually useful in a multiprocessing environment, where a separate processor can operate on each odd pair simultaneously and then on each even pair. Because the odd pairs are independent of each other, each pair can be checked—and swapped, if necessary—by a different processor. This makes for a very fast sort."

    "Modify the `insertionSort()` method in SortArray.py (Listing 3-4) so that it counts the number of copies and the number of item comparisons it makes during a sort and displays the totals. You need to look at the loop condition in the inner while loop and carefully count item comparisons. Use this program to measure the number of copies and comparisons for different amounts of inversely sorted data. Do the results verify **O(N2)** efficiency? Do the same for almost-sorted data (only a few items out of place). What can you deduce about the efficiency of this algorithm for almost-sorted data?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Answer**\n",
    " * **Inversely sorted input:** Insertion sort does about half of the pairs’ worth of work shifting and comparing, so your measurements should grow roughly like ~(N²/2) for comparisons and ~(N²/2 + N) writes. This empirically verifies **O(N²)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Almost-sorted input:** Insertion sort’s cost is proportional to the number of inversions (out-of-order pairs). With only a few items misplaced, there are few inversions, so the totals should be close to **O(N + K)** where K is the number of inversions (often near **O(N)**).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Conclusion:** Insertion sort is very efficient on nearly sorted data—practically linear—making it a great choice when the array is already almost in order."
