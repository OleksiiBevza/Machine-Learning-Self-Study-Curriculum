    "# **11. HASH TABLE**\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these amazing features, hash tables have several disadvantages. They’re based on arrays, and expanding arrays after they’ve been allocated can cause challenges. If there \n",
    "will be many deletions after inserting many items, there can be significant amounts of unused memory. For some kinds of hash tables, performance may degrade catastrophi\n",
    "cally when a table becomes too full, so programmers need to have a fairly accurate idea of how many data items will be stored (or be prepared to periodically transfer data to a \n",
    "larger hash table, a time-consuming process). Also, there’s no convenient way to visit the items in a hash table in any kind of order (such as from smallest to largest)\n",
    "\n",
    "**However, if you don’t need to visit items in order, and you can predict in advance the size of your database or accept some extra memory usage and a tiny bit of slowness as the database is built up, hash tables are unparalleled in speed and convenience.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Hashing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are trying to squeeze numbers in the range 0 to 199 into the range 0 to 9. The range of the big numbers is 200, whereas the smaller range has only 10. If you want \n",
    "to convert a big number (stored in a variable called largeNumber) into the smaller range (and store it in the variable smallNumber), you could use the following assignment, where smallRange has the value 10:\n",
    "\n",
    "`smallNumber = largeNumber % smallRange`\n",
    "\n",
    "The remainders when any number is divided by 10 are always in the range 0 to 9; for example, 13 % 10 gives 3, and 157 % 10 is 7. With decimal numbers, it simply means \n",
    "getting the last digit. The modulo operation compresses a large range into a smaller one.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar expression can be used to compress the really huge numbers that uniquely represent every English word into index numbers that fit in the dictionary array:\n",
    "\n",
    "`arrayIndex = hugeNumber % arraySize`\n",
    "\n",
    "The function that computes the hugeNumber is an example of a **hash function**. It hashes a piece of data into a smaller number. Taking the modulo with the arraySize maps the number into a smaller range. This smaller range is the range of index numbers in an array. The array into which the hashed data is inserted is called a **hash table**. The index to which a particular key maps is called the **hash address**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Collissions in hashing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when the ratio of items to hash table cells is less than 10 percent (23 out of 366), the chance of a collision is greater than 50 percent. That means you should plan your \n",
    "hash tables to always deal with collisions. **Collision** occurs when the same hash code is assigned for a different number. The word bring has a unique code of 1,424,122, which is converted to 24,122 by taking the modulo with 100,000. The word abductor has the unique code 11,303,824,122, and missable has 139,754,124,122. All three of them hash to index 24,122 of the hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approaches to deal with collissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Open addressing:** to search the array in some systematic way for an empty cell and insert the new item there, instead of at the index specified by the hash address. If abductor hashes to 24,122, but this location is already occupied by bring, then you might try to insert abductor in cell 24,123, for example. When the insert operation finds an empty cell, it stores both the key and its associated value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Separate chaining** to create an array that consists of references to another data structure (like linked lists of words) instead of the records for the individual \n",
    "words. Then, when a collision occurs, the new item is simply inserted in the list at that index. \n",

    "### **11.1.1. LINEAR PROBING** \n",
    "\n",
    "In linear probing, the algorithm searches sequentially for vacant cells. If cell 5,421 is occupied when it tries to insert a data item there, it goes to 5,422, then 5,423, and so on, incrementing the index until it finds an empty cell. This operation is called linear probing because it steps sequentially along the line of cells.\n",

    "\n",
    "If a table is full by 50 % a new table is being created (this time 2 much bigger then previous one) and rehashing takes place. The hashing function hasn’t changed, nor have the keys, so it might appear that the items would end up in their same relative positions. Because the size of the table grew, however, the modulo operator produces new cell indices. \n",
